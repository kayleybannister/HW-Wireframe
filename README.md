This is the first homework I created for Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. 

In this assignment, I used HTML & CSS to create a basic webpage. I also used Git to push all of my code to GitHub.

The HTML consisted of several sections:
    - Header
    - Navbar
    - Aside
    - Section
    - Article
    - Headers within the Article
    - Paragraph within the Article 
    
    The CSS consisted of several style elements:
    - Body
    - font-family: 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
    - color: '#777'
    - background: '#777'
    - width: '960px'
    - font-size: '18px'
    - Header, Nav, Section, Aside, and Footer
    - background: '#ebebeb'
    - Article
    - color: '#ebebeb',
    - background: '#777'
    - h1 and p
    - color: '#777',
    - background: '#ebebeb'
